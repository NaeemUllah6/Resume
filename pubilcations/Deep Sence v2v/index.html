          High data rate and low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication are essential
          for future intelligent transport systems to enable coordination, enhance safety,
          and support distributed computing and intelligence requirements. Developing effective
          communication strategies, however, demands realistic test scenarios and datasets.
          This is important at the high-frequency bands where more spectrum is available, yet
          harvesting this bandwidth is challenged by the need for direction transmission
          and the sensitivity of signal propagation to blockages. This work presents the
          first large-scale multi-modal dataset for studying mmWave vehicle-to-vehicle
          communications. It presents a two-vehicle testbed that comprises data from a
          360-degree camera, four radars, four 60 GHz phased arrays, a 3D lidar, and
          two precise GPSs. The dataset contains vehicles driving during the day and
          night for 120 km in intercity and rural settings, with speeds up to 100 km
          per hour. More than one million objects were detected across all images, from
          trucks to bicycles. This work further includes detailed dataset statistics
          that prove the coverage of various situations and highlights how this dataset
          can enable novel machine-learning applications.

          Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication has become increasingly essential in intelligent transportation systems
          (ITS)
          for enabling vehicles to exchange critical information, enhancing safety, traffic efficiency, and the overall
          driving experience
          [1]. However, the current methods of V2V communication face
          challenges with the increasing volume and complexity of data
          being exchanged, which might limit the effectiveness of the
          ITS [2]. This demand for higher data rates in V2V communication motivates the exploration of higher frequency
          bands such
          as millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
          frequencies. The mmWave/sub-THz frequency ranges offer
          larger bandwidths, making them well-suited for supporting
          the high-speed and data-intensive requirements of V2V communication systems [3]. Additionally, the
          availability of large
          antenna arrays and beamforming capabilities in mmWave/subTHz V2V communication systems enable robust and
          efficient
          communication, mitigating the effects of interference and
          signal attenuation in dynamic and congested environments.
          Adopting advanced wireless communication technologies in
          V2V systems facilitates reliable data exchange between vehicles, even in high-speed scenarios, where rapid and
          accurate
          information dissemination is crucial for collision avoidance,
          cooperative driving, and other vehicular applications.

          supported by the National Science Foundation
          under Grant No. 2048021.
          Further, future wireless systems, specifically in 6G and
          beyond, are envisioned to incorporate communication, multimodal sensing, and positioning capabilities as
          integral components [4], [5]. These systems are anticipated to implement coexisting communication and sensing
          functionalities or leverage
          one to enhance the other, accentuating the growing importance
          of the synergy between multi-modal sensing and communication. This synergy has been driving key research
          directions
          such as multi-modal sensing-aided communication [6]–[14]
          and integrated sensing and communication [15]. Moreover,
          with the rise of autonomous vehicles, there is an increasing focus on equipping vehicles with multiple
          sensors, such
          as radar, LiDAR, and cameras, enabling vehicles to gather
          comprehensive situational awareness. Incorporating co-located
          communication and sensing functionalities will likely be the
          key to enabling reliable and efficient V2V communication.
          Multi-modal sensing capabilities can help navigate complex
          and dynamic scenarios on the road effectively. A detailed perception of the environment can enhance V2V
          communication
          reliability, facilitate advanced decision-making algorithms, and
          improve overall safety and efficiency in complex and dynamic
          environments. Despite these benefits, fully realizing efficient
          V2V communication presents challenges, particularly when
          dealing with mmWave/sub-THz frequency communication.
          The realization of efficient mmWave vehicle-to-vehicle
          communication benefits from (i) the development of sophisticated detection and tracking algorithms and (ii)
          the resolution
          of the unique challenges posed by mmWave/sub-THz communication systems. First, the development of
          sophisticated
          detection and tracking algorithms can support directional
          beamforming and blockage detection/tracking in mmWave
          systems. Second, the utilization of mmWave/sub-THz frequencies introduces challenges. For instance, adjusting
          the narrow
          beams in these communication systems with large antenna
          arrays is typically associated with large training overhead that
          scales with the number of antennas, making it challenging
          to support high-mobility applications such as V2V communication. Further, line-of-sight (LOS)link blockages
          such as
          buildings and other vehicles can disrupt communication and
          challenge the link reliability. Although several multi-modal
          datasets [16]–[18] recently have been made available targeting
          autonomous vehicles, the development of large-scale datasets
          designed explicitly for V2V communication is lacking. To
          address these challenges, it is crucial to create comprehensive
          multi-modal sensing-aided V2V communication datasets that
          capture real-world scenarios, enabling researchers to design
          and evaluate algorithms and protocols for this specific context.

          tailored for V2V communication research, we present the
          DeepSense 6G V2V dataset, the world’s first large-scale
          real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset
          designed to facilitate V2V communication research and algorithm development. The DeepSense 6G V2V dataset is
          (i) a large-scale dataset of more than 125k data points,
          (ii) based on real-world measurements. The dataset comprises co-existing and synchronized multi-modal sensing
          and
          communication data and is organized in a collection of 4
          scenarios captured from a diverse range of driving conditions
          and environments. These scenarios encompass urban, suburban, and rural highway settings, incorporating
          different traffic
          densities and road and weather conditions.
          The DeepSense V2V dataset provides several key features
          that are essential for advancing V2V communication research:
          • Co-existing sensing and communication: The
          DeepSense V2V dataset consists of a large-scale
          collection of V2V mmWave communication data
          integrated with multi-modal sensing information. This
          unique combination empowers researchers to gain
          comprehensive insights into V2V scenarios, enabling
          them to explore the intricate interactions between sensor
          modalities and communication systems.
          • Co-located 360-degree sensor coverage: The DeepSense
          V2V dataset leverages a diverse sensor suite, including cameras, radar, LiDAR, positioning sensors, and
          mmWave communication devices, to provide a 360-
          degree coverage around the vehicle. This integration
          of different sensor modalities enables a comprehensive
          understanding of the surrounding environment, capturing
          rich data from visual observations, object detection, depth
          perception, positioning, and wireless communication dynamics. Moreover, the co-location of the sensors allows
          researchers to correlate sensory data better.
          • Real World diverse scenarios: The DeepSense V2V
          dataset is collected in real-world environments, providing
          a realistic representation of V2V communication scenarios in different locations, weather conditions, lighting
          settings, and traffic conditions. The dataset accurately
          captures real-world complexities and incorporates varying traffic densities, road conditions, and
          environmental
          influences.
          • Large-scale data: Developing deep learning solutions
          that are scalable and robust to data distribution shifts (due
          to changes in the environment or deployment) requires the
          availability of a large-scale dataset. The DeepSense V2V
          dataset provides a large-scale collection of multi-modal
          data samples, comprising more than 125k data points
          across four scenarios. This dataset’s large-scale nature can
          help develop and evaluate advanced algorithms such as
          generalizability, robustness to distribution shift, etc.
          This paper presents a detailed description of the DeepSense
          6G V2V dataset, including its acquisition methodology, data
          formats, available scenarios, and annotations. Furthermore, we
          provide example use cases and highlight potential applications
          of the dataset in V2V communication research and algorithm
          development.
          II. LITERATURE REVIEW
          In recent years, publicly available datasets [16]–[26], [28]–
          [30] have played a significant role in advancing the development of autonomous vehicle technologies. A summary
          of some
          of these key datasets is provided in Table I. These datasets
          typically include data from various sensors, such as cameras,
          LiDARs, and GPS/IMU. They are often used for tasks such as
          object detection and segmentation, scene understanding, and
          localization and mapping. The KITTI dataset [20], with over
          22 scenes, has been widely used for testing machine learning
          algorithms for vision tasks, such as object detection, using
          LiDAR and camera data. It provides 2D and 3D annotation
          data and has about 80k 2D and 3D bounding boxes. The H3D
          dataset [25] includes 160 crowded scenes with 27k frames,

          vehicle and a phased array mounted on a tripod. A schematic
          of the dimensions of the V2V box and its position in the car
          is shown in Figure 3. This section describes the sensors that
          generated the data in this dataset and the collection context in
          which data was acquired.
          Sensor Suite: It comprises different sensors with different
          functions and limitations, as well as different sampling times
          and physical interface requirements (i.e., for power and connectivity). All non-communication sensors - the
          four
          radars,
          the 3D lidar, the 360º camera, and the two GPSs - operate in
          continuous data acquisition mode with a predefined sample
          rate. This is not the case with the mmWave beam power
          collection, where the receiver radio and phased arrays are
          programmatically triggered to collect a sample every 100 ms.
          A beam power sample consists of a sweep of the 64 beams
          spanning -45 to +45 degrees in azimuth and measuring the
          received power in each of those beams. This 64-valued power
          vector is our unitary sample for communications.
          Besides the mmWave beam powers, the testbed comprises
          2 GPSs using the L1 and L2 bands for higher accuracy - the
          horizontal accuracies are always within a meter of the true,
          according to manufacturer information and horizontal dilution
          measures returned by the device. The testbed also holds a 360º
          video camera, which is used to export four 90º views and
          two 180º views around the car, effectively covering all angles
          and emulating the existence of multiple cameras around the
          vehicle. The single lidar in the testbed creates a 32 thousandpoint 3D point cloud with a maximum range of 200
          meters.
          In terms of range, the configurations of the four radars allow
          more than 200 maximum distance, but factors like clutter and
          ADC resolution prevent such ranges in realistic road situations.
          More information on the sensors, like each sample rate, the
          location of the sensors in each unit, specific resolutions, and
          configurations, can be consulted in Table II.
          Collection Procedure: The data was acquired in the following way. First, all the sensors are initialized at
          the
          start of
          collecting data. The mmWave power captured by the box in
          unit 1 comes from an omnidirectional transmitter in car/unit
          2. This transmitter is attached to a tripod and is manually
          rotated to guarantee power at the receiver (unit 1). The system
          is capable of displaying the power received in each beam in
          real time. This monitoring capability is used mainly to start
          vehicle movement once a received power vector is visually
          verified. The trajectory is coarsely planned ahead of time. The
          two vehicles attempt to stay relatively close throughout the

          collection such that the received power in the optimum beam
          is higher than the noise floor. As the distance grows, the blockages also become more likely. Nonetheless, in
          LoS
          conditions,
          the received power in the best beam is distinguishable from
          noise over 500-meter distances. This distance is more likely
          achieved in V2I situations. For example, in a V2I situation,
          the box can play the role of a basestation or be placed in
          the car to communicate with a static unit that acts as the BS.
          Effectively, the testbed described here can be used in a range
          of V2X applications.
          B. Data Processing
          The intermediate stage of DeepSense scenario creation is
          data processing. While DeepSense Collection deals with data
          acquisition from sensors, often involving manufacturer-specific
          caveats, DeepSense Processing deals more generally with
          processing data formats independently of the sensor they come
          from. The data processing stage consists of two major phases:
          • Phase 1: converts data from the sensors of all modalities
          in timestamped samples. For example, a data capture with
          the lidar sensor is usually saved in a single file unsuitable
          for proper data synchronization. This phase takes care of
          extracting all samples and metadata for the sensor-specific
          data format and organizes them in clear CSVs. It may
          further interpolate data points (currently only in GPS).
          • Phase 2: filters, organizes, creates sequences of continuous data acquisition, and synchronizes the
          extracted data
          into a processed DeepSense scenario.
          Phase 1 processes different modalities in parallel, with specific
          steps tailored to each modality. For instance, GPS samples in
          the NMEA protocol format require different processing than
          video data from a 360º camera. While detailed descriptions
          of Phase 1 are beyond the scope of this discussion, it is
          essential to note that data and metadata are extracted from
          their original formats into a common structure suitable for
          ingestion and synchronization in Phase 2. Phase 2, unlike
          Phase 1, processes data sequentially and is agnostic to data
          formats. This phase focuses on data synchronization, filtering,
          sequencing, labeling, and compression. This discussion will
          primarily concentrate on the functions of Phase 2.

          Data Visualization provides significant value in several
          fronts: dataset interpretability and understanding, fast identification of the samples of interest, easier
          recognition of propagation phenomena, like reflections, blockages, large distances
          radio transmission, and easier spotting of adverse sensor conditions, such as hard visibility from light or
          weather and excessive radar clutter. To enable these advantages, the DeepSense
          scenario creation pipeline leverages a data visualization user
          interface (UI) in the DeepSense Viewer library. We use this UI
          to verify the individual stages of data processing and to render
          a final scenario video that synchronizes all processed data.
          An example of a scenario video is depicted in Figure 4. This
          figure shows all modalities present in the dataset, including
          both units. Some modalities are normalized only to facilitate
          the visualization, namely by assuring relevant features are not
          hidden by ill-defined scales or less-clear colormaps. The data
          displayed in each frame of the video is from the same time
          instant and corresponds to one row of the indexing CSV.
          <br><strong>Scenario videos:</strong> Using the user interface built within
          the DeepSense Viewer module, we render a video for each
          scenario where data is displayed across time. In our experience, this video makes data easy to navigate and
          allows the
          researcher to find the moments of interest. These videos are
          rendered at four times the real-world speed to allow the user
          to visualize large portions of the dataset quickly. YouTube
          allows a 0.25x speed control that will bring the speed back
          to the real world, and for finer controls, the user can use
          keyboard shortcuts to navigate the video frame by frame -
          for this reason, the video is rendered to have a different
          sample in each frame. These videos can be found on the
          web page of the V2V DeepSense Scenarios (i.e., Scenarios36-
          39).In this paper, however, we will show the variability and
          reach of the proposed dataset differently from videos. In the
          following section, we show interesting patterns and statistics
          that researchers can exploit for developing machine learning
          algorithms for V2V communications

          A useful dataset with wide applicability in wireless communications should contain substantial variability
          while being
          accurate and consistent. This section shows many statistics
          about the location and speed of the vehicles during the
          data collection in Section IV-A. Then it delves into how
          received power relates to distance in Section IV-B to prove the
          consistency of data. Subsequently, mmWave and GPS data are
          again related when we display beam distributions and position
          distribution across time in IV-C, showing that the direction of
          the incoming signal strongly correlates with the beam. This
          should be because LoS is the predominant link status during
          collection. Then, Section IV-D shows the results obtained
          from applying machine vision detection and classification
          approaches to the visual data. This section illustrates the visual

          wireless communications but also GPS, Lidar, and Radar. In
          Figure 5, we illustrate the locations of the receiver captured
          by the GPS (undersampled by a factor of 100 to facilitate
          readability), along with other macro statistics of the data
          collection. Scenarios 36 and 37 are collected in long drives
          between cities, targeting long travels, while Scenarios 38
          and 39 are more oriented to emulate short urban commutes,
          so data is predominantly inside cities. For this reason, we
          call Scenarios 36 and 37 inter-city scenarios and 38 and 39
          urban scenarios. The difference is corroborated by the traveled
          distance and average speed. While Scenarios 36 and 37 have
          long-distance travel at relatively high average speeds, 38 and
          39 traveled less at a lower speed because of speed limits within
          cities. We further look into speed distributions in Figure 6.
          Furthermore, we include information like the lighting and
          weather conditions relevant to accessing the capabilities of
          cameras versus lidars and radars. For completeness’ sake, the
          time of the first and last samples are included to describe the
          span of the collection. Note, however, that during the data
          collection, there are intermittent pauses in the acquisition of
          data. This justifies why the span of the collection and the
          filtered duration of the collection often have different numbers,
          with the former bigger than the latter. Some reasons for such
          pauses can be associated with hardware limitations, like the
          need to change batteries in the 360 camera, or they can be
          associated with errors in the collection where cars got too far
          apart and the signal got interrupted for a long time, or when
          one of the sensors had an error and did not acquire data for
          some time. We opt not to include samples where all modalities
          are not present.
          Speed distributions can tell the diversity of vehicle movement speeds in the dataset. Moreover, given that the
          speed

          speed limits (in mph) and the type of road that matches the interval of speeds.
          limits were closely followed during data collection, we can
          further extrapolate what kind of roads the vehicles were
          on from their speed. Information on the type of roads is
          relevant because it tells what kind of objects and phenomena
          we expect to find in those samples. Figure 6 shows each
          scenario’s cumulative distributions of speeds. We can observe
          that the intercity / rural scenarios (36 and 37) have a more
          flat distribution with contributions from higher speeds than
          the urban scenarios (38 and 39). Higher speeds come from
          driving in free-ways, and very low speeds result from traffic
          lights, intersections, and stop signs, characteristics of dense
          urban mobility. We also indicate the speed limit regulations in
          Arizona, USA, in miles per hour. This information allows us to
          estimate, for example, that the car in Scenario 38 was stopped
          in traffic lights for over 20% of the time and that the car
          in Scenario 39 was driven in alleys or in residential/business
          districts for about 50% of the time.
          B. Inter-vehicle Distance and Received Power
          The distance between the receiver and transmitter and the
          received power in the optimum beam are closely related to
          the radio propagation theory of a LoS link. Since this dataset
          uses mmWave frequencies, which require a LoS in most cases,
          this dataset should reflect the power-distance relation. We
          show this relation across all scenarios by charting in Figure 7
          the distance (or, more accurately, the inverse of the distance
          square) and the received power. The figure shows a strong
          correlation between distance and received power. But there
          also are cases where the correlation is broken (e.g., from
          sample 7500 to 8100 of Scenario 36) due to blockage and
          NLoS. Furthermore, it should be noted that the powers present
          in this dataset are not in Watts. We acquire baseband powers
          by computing the square of the amplitude of the baseband
          samples. Accurately measuring received powers at the antenna
          requires a difficult calibration process with both the receiver
          and transmitter. Instead, we attempted to perform data collection always within the linear regions of all
          components. As
          such, the relation between distance and received power should
          hold. This is suggested by the results in Figure 7.

          One differentiation factor of this dataset is that it includes
          beam information. Accordingly, we include Figure 8 that
          shows variations in the optimal beam across time and how
          they contribute to the overall beam density distribution. The
          figure also shows interesting phenomena. For example, given
          that most propagation in mmWave communications happens
          in LoS, we observe a continuous transition between beam
          indices. If beam continuity is interrupted, it can only be
          because of two reasons: i) the data collection was interrupted
          and the cars restarted in different positions, in which case
          we indicate that by changing sequences, since each sequence
          marks a continuous collection; ii) the second reason is when
          the cars get sufficiently far way NLoS or blockage.
          The visualization in Figure 8 also allows us to identify
          particular phenomena we might be interested in studying.
          Moreover, we color the beams from each panel with different
          colors; therefore, when we see that when a color changes
          (between indices 63/64, 127/128, and 191/192), it means a
          different panel or array is selected at the device (car). Also,
          in all scenarios, the beam distribution is concentrated in the
          middle of the front and back arrays. This is intuitive because
          two cars rarely spend long periods of time at the side of each
          other, but rather long times in front or at the back of each other.
          This is why there are long periods where the optimal beam
          lies in the middle of the front and back arrays (respectively
          colored in blue and green). We can also spot overtakes when
          we see a transition between front and back arrays, passing
          through the side arrays (colored in orange and red).
          Beam and Relative Position Densities: It is essential to
          highlight the relation between beams and positions. We already
          showed this relation by relating the distance between the
          vehicles and the received power in Figure 7. Now we highlight
          with respect to angle. Figures 9 and 10 show the distributions
          of beams in angle and relative positions between the two cars.
          Although it is not perfect, we see a strong correlation between
          the two. The relation is not perfect because of NLoS events
          and because the relative position is not always equivalent to the
          variable that should correlate perfectly with the optimal beam
          direction, the angle of arrival (AoA). Those situations happen
          when the receiver vehicle has a different orientation than the
          transmitter vehicle, thus changing the arrival angle without
          changing the relative position computed via GPS positions.
          In Section VI, we further augment our estimation of AoA to
          relate with beam choice more accurately. In the figure, we also
          see that the predominant beam directions and relative positions
          agree with the tendency for vehicles to drive in front or behind
          each other.
          D. Machine Vision and Image Detection
          Modern cars, especially autonomous and semi-autonomous,
          already have cameras for several driving-related functions.
          To aid communications, for autonomous driving purposes,
          simply for security reasons or to increase the understanding
          of the environment, the content captured by cameras can be
          very useful. As such, we present in Figure 11 what a pretrained state-of-the-art image model, YOLOv8 [35], detects
          when enabled in detection mode. We executed the model to
          detect and classify objects in all 180º images of the dataset.
          These images were rendered from the 360º camera depicting
          the front and the back of the vehicle, totaling more than 250
          thousand images. Figure 12 illustrates the results calibrated
          to remove detections of our own car. The results indicate
          that most objects detected are cars, traffic lights, trucks, and
          people. Having presented several dataset statistics relevant
          to its application, in the next section, we describe possible
          applications of the V2V dataset.

          This section discusses the diverse applications enabled by
          the DeepSense 6G V2V dataset, spanning wireless communication, vehicular localization, and autonomous sensing applications. The multi-modal dataset provides invaluable resources
          for enhancing beamforming, predicting blockages, improving positioning systems, and developing efficient autonomous
          sensing algorithms. These applications highlight the wideranging impact of our dataset in advancing V2V communications and autonomous vehicle technologies.

          rate demands of V2V communication, it is crucial to equip
          these systems with mmWave/THz transceivers, which require
          large antenna arrays and narrow directive beams to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. However, adjusting these narrow
          beams comes with a significant training overhead that scales

      Optimal beam across time and corresponding beam distribution for all Scenarios show a tendency of vehicles driving in front or behind each other.
      Different colors represent beam indices on different phased arrays to provide panel-switching context information. Interruptions are due to sequence changing
      (see Section III-B) or blockage due to other vehicles. In low SNR regimes, e.g., near sample 20000 of Scenario 36, the optimal beam becomes ambiguou    </p>

    with the number of antennas, posing challenges for supporting high-mobility V2V applications. Additionally, the highly
    mobile nature of V2V communication necessitates frequent
    updates to the optimal beam index that further increase this
    beam training overhead. The high mobility-induced frequent

    low latency and high reliability. Delving deeper into the beam
    selection process reveals the following insights: Firstly, in
    mmWave/THz systems, beamforming is directional, which
    means that the optimal beam indices depend on the relative
    position of the transmitter and receiver. Secondly, objects in
    the wireless environment, whether stationary or moving, can
    affect the availability of the line-of-sight path and alter the
